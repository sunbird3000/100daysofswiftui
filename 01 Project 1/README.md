# Project 1 - We Split 

This project includes the code to a check-sharing app that calculates how to split a check based on the number of people and how much tip you want to leave. 
It also includes the code for the challenge part of the project.

### Hacking with Swift
https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/16 


## Topics Covered: 
1. Basic Structure of SwiftUI App 
2. Building forms, text fields and sections 
3. Creating navigation views and bar titles 
4. Creating views in a loop using ForEach
5. Creating UI controls like TextField and Picker 
6. Storing program state with @State property wrapper 


## Challenge (solved): 

* Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
* Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
* Change the “Number of people” picker to be a text field, making sure to use the correct keyboard type.
