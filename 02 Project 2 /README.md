### Hacking with Swift

## Topics Covered: 
1. Using stacks to arrange views 
2. How to create gradients, colors, buttons, images and showing alerts


## Challenge (solved): 

* Add an @State property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert.
* Show the player’s current score in a label directly below the flags.
* When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
